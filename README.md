# Balanced ACH API [Beta]

The goal of this API is to let you debit (withdrawal) from and credit (deposit)
to bank accounts in the US using next business day
[ACH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Clearing_House) transfers.
Balanced already provides an API to charge cards, holds funds in escrow,
and deposit to bank accounts. This API has been broken off, for now, to let the
Balanced team build add ACH debits without altering the existing stable API
(`v1`). Aspects of this API have already been and will continue to be merged
into `v1`.
