# ACH API (Experimental)

Balanced is considering providing a experimental API to get ACH debits out as soon as possible until we determine how to incorporate ACH debits into the production/stable (v1) API. The experimental API would also permit ACH credits without requiring the recipient be underwritten as a merchant.

This is not intended as a new version, and marketplaces should be able to use both APIs in conjunction until the functionality is merged into v1. The same API keys and marketplace escrow will be used.

## Versioning

Any breaking would require a new version. New versions will be released on Wednesday mornings. Previous versions will be active for two weeks (14 days) from when the new version is released to provide a transition time.
