Feature: External accounts

  charging and crediting to customers.

    {
      "provider": "test",
      "token": "123123123123"
    }
    """
    When I GET "external_accounts.href" from the previous response
    Then I should get a 200 OK status code
    And the response is valid according to the "external_accounts" schema

  Scenario: Retrieve an external account
