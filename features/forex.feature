Feature: Forex
  Foreign currency exchange, hereafter 'forex', is a feature that allows
  marketplaces to charge thier buyers in non-USD currencies.

  This provides a better experience for customers who have accounts denominated
  in other currencies, and reduces chargeback rates for those customers as well.

  Scenario: Debit a card in €
    Given I have tokenized a card
    When I make a POST request to the link "cards.debits" with the body:
      """
      {
        "debits": [{
          "amount": 2000,
          "currency": "EUR"
        }]
      }
      """
    Then I should get a 201 Created status code
    And the response is valid according to the "debits" schema
    And the fields on this debit match:
      """
      {
        "currency": "EUR"
      }
      """

  Scenario: Debiting a card directly in €
    When I POST to /debits with the body:
      """
      {
        "debits": [{
          "amount": 1234,
          "source": {
            "number": "4111111111111111",
            "expiration_year": "2018",
            "expiration_month": 12
          },
          "currency": "EUR"
        }]
      }
      """
    Then I should get a 201 Created status code
    And the response is valid according to the "debits" schema
    And the fields on this debit match:
      """
      {
        "currency": "EUR"
      }
      """
