Feature: Credit cards
  "Tokenizing" a credit card is the process of sending Balanced a credit card
  number for storage. The API will then give the customer back a token that the
  customer will store. The idea is that if a customer stored the credit card data
  directly, the customer would legally be required to take extra precautions for safely storing the information, whereas with the token, Balanced worries about
  that, and the customer just charges against the token rather than the card.

  For more on tokenization as a concept, see ['tokenization' on
  Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization_%28data_security%29)

  Scenario: Tokenize a card without a secret key
    Cards are able to be tokenized without sending along a secret key. When
    this happens, the customer gets less information than if the key was sent.

    When I POST to /cards without my secret key with the JSON API body:
      """
