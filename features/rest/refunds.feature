Feature: Refunds
  Refunds are used to cancel a debit.  The marketplace can either refund the whole amount
  of the debit or a partial amount of the debit using "amount" when creating the refund.

  Scenario: Creating a full refund
    Given I have debited a card
    When I POST to /debits/:debit_id/refunds
    Then I should get a 201 Created status code
    And the response is valid according to the "refunds" schema

  Scenario: Creating a partial refund
    Given I have debited a card
    When I POST to /debits/:debit_id/refunds with the JSON API body:
    """
    {
      "refunds": [{
        "amount": 100,
        "description": "The customer was unhappy",
        "meta": {
          "reason": "not shipped"
        }
      }]
    }
    """
    Then I should get a 201 Created status code
    And the response is valid according to the "refunds" schema
    And the fields on this refund match:
    """

      "amount": 100
